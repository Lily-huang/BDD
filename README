issue:
1.gradle can not find the tests and throw error at first, after run it with maven, fixed.
2.when add the cucumberOptions 'strict = false,monochrome = true,dryRun=true', my tests are always ignored.

To do:
1.when I give mutiple objects, I can't recognise which object I should use as there's always get all objects in the list.
